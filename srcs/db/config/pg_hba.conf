# PostgreSQL Host-Based Authentication (HBA) Configuration

# This file controls PostgreSQL client authentication by defining:
# 	- Which users can connect (all because is an internal docker network)
# 	- From which hosts they can connect (all because is an internal docker network)
# 	- To which databases they can connect (all because is an internal docker network)
#	- What authentication method should be used (md5 because is a secure method)

# Format of each record:
# TYPE  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD

# Configuration for Transcendence project:
# 1. Local connections use 'trust' for development ease
# 2. Network connections require password authentication with SSL
# 3. All Docker containers can connect with proper credentials
# 4. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

# Database administrative login (local Unix-domain socket)
local   all             all                                    trust

# Allow local network connections with password
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32           md5
host    all             all             ::1/128                md5

# Allow all Docker network connections with password authentication and require SSL
hostssl all             all             all                    md5
# Also add a non-SSL fallback for diagnostics
host    all             all             all                    md5
