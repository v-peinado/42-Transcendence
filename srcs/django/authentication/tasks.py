# To see celery tasks in action:

# 1. Create a new user

# 2. Run the Celery worker: in a terminal:
#	docker exec -it srcs-web-1 celery -A main worker -l INFO

# 3. Run the Celery beat scheduler: in a new terminal:
#	docker exec -it srcs-web-1 celery -A main beat -l INFO

# 4. Trigger the task: in a new terminal:
#	docker exec -it srcs-web-1 python manage.py shell
#	from authentication.tasks import cleanup_inactive_users
#	cleanup_inactive_users.delay()

# 5. Check logs in the worker terminal

# 6. Check the database to see if the user was deleted
