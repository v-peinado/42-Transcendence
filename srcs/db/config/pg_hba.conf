# PostgreSQL Host-Based Authentication (HBA) Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------
#
# This file controls PostgreSQL client authentication by defining:
# - Which users can connect
# - From which hosts they can connect
# - To which databases they can connect
# - What authentication method should be used
#
# Format of each record:
# TYPE  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD
#
# Authentication Methods:
# - trust: Allow connection unconditionally
# - md5: Require password authentication with MD5 hashing
# - scram-sha-256: Password authentication using SCRAM-SHA-256
# - peer: Use operating system's user credentials
#
# Configuration for Transcendence project:
# 1. Local connections use 'trust' for development ease
# 2. Network connections require password authentication
# 3. All Docker containers can connect with proper credentials
# 4. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

# Database administrative login (local Unix-domain socket)
local   all             all                                    trust

# Allow local network connections with password
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32           md5
host    all             all             ::1/128                md5

# Allow all Docker network connections with password authentication
host    all             all             all                    md5
